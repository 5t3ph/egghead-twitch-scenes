# Develop Custom Twitch Scenes and Setup in OBS

These are the supporting files for **[the egghead course](https://5t3ph.dev/ets)**.

You'll learn how to:

- setup scenes with Eleventy as the build tool
- use ComfyJS to embed chat and respond to chat commands
- run the scenes locally and display in OBS

The `lessons` directory includes the progressive build steps for each lesson in the egghead course.

## Course Scripts

The following are for running resources from the course root. You can also copy individual lesson directories and run them individually as unique projects.

All scripts are run in the root package.

1. `yarn` installs all dependencies.
1. `yarn start 01` (replace with lesson number or keyword) runs the project in the browser.
1. `yarn latest` updates all dependencies.
1. `yarn clean:node_modules` deletes `node_modules` recursively.
